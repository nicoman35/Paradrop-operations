# Paradrop-operations
Paradrop infantry units and vehicles

This mod is dependent on following mods:

1. CBA
2. Backpack On Chest - Redux

1. Part
This little mod will enable pilots and copilots of air vehicles capable of transporting troops to command those troops to get ready for paradropping. AI only.
The units not already fitted out with a parachute will search the inventory of the vehicle for parachutes. If found, they will equip those parachutes as backpacks.
The units already fitted out with a backpack will move the original backpack to the chest.
After commanding 'get ready for paradrop', pilot or copilot can define a paradrop destination. 
Units within the vehicle can now be selected to eject the vehicle. 
Upon ejection, the troops will actively try to reach a safe location, or, if defined, the designated paradrop destination.


2. Part
The mod adds a 'Vehicle Parachute'. It can be attached to any vehicle with a mass between 0.25 t and 80 t. If those vehicles are dropped from an air transport vehicle,
e.g. by slingloading, the paracute will open and the vehicle will glide to ground.
